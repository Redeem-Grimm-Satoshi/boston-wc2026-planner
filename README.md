# Boston Stadium Isn't in Boston

Developed an intelligent FIFA World Cup 2026 Match-Day Planner that was recognized as one of the Top 5 projects at the PyData Boston × Cursor Boston Hackathon. The solution helps visitors arriving in Boston navigate their journey from hotel to stadium by generating personalized, data-driven itineraries. Built as an interactive Marimo notebook, the project integrates eight live public datasets, including transportation, traffic, weather, and public safety data, to optimize travel plans for matches at Gillette Stadium in Foxborough, Massachusetts.

Recognizing that Gillette Stadium sits 30 miles south of downtown Boston and that Route 1 is among the state's most hazardous traffic corridors, the platform delivers intelligent recommendations that improve travel efficiency, safety, and the overall fan experience. The project stood out among hackathon participants for its real-world impact, innovative use of public data, and practical application of data science to large-scale sporting events.


Built for the Cursor / PyData Boston 2026 hackathon.

## What it does

After a single match pick and an optional starting address, the notebook auto-generates:

- A **personalized itinerary card** with closest Commuter Rail station (name, real street address, walking + driving time), transfer routing if the station isn't on the Foxboro Line, and a door-to-stadium timing chain working backward from kickoff.
- A **live MBTA map** — 9 routes (Red, Orange, Blue, Green B/C/D/E, Silver Line SL1, Foxboro/Franklin) with vehicle positions polled every 15 s and smoothly interpolated client-side at 50 ms ticks.
- A **match-day weather forecast** — live for matches inside Open-Meteo's 16-day window, historical-average fallback for matches farther out.
- A **MBTA reliability snapshot** ranking lines as Most Reliable vs Plan Extra Time.
- A **places map** of hotels, motels, bars, restaurants, public restrooms, and parks pulled live from OpenStreetMap. Restaurants tagged with the visitor's home cuisine are flagged with their country's flag emoji.
- A **family-friendly cities map** with click-through tourist attractions for 21 curated MA cities.
- A **crash-data overlay** of fatal / serious-injury incident counts for the visitor's chosen city.
- A **personalized conclusion** with concrete safety advice tailored to the visitor's starting point.

## Data sources

| Layer | Source | Auth |
|---|---|---|
| Crash records | MassDOT IMPACT Open Data | none |
| Live transit | MBTA V3 API | none (optional key) |
| Weather | Open-Meteo (forecast + archive) | none |
| Places (hotels, food, restrooms) | OpenStreetMap Overpass | none |
| Geocoding + reverse geocoding | OpenStreetMap Nominatim | none |
| Driving routing | OSRM public demo | none |
| Hero city image + intro | Wikipedia REST | none |
| City safety overlay | FBI UCR 2024 (curated) | n/a |

No paid API keys required. All data sources are free and public.

## Loading icon

The spinning loader and custom mouse cursor use `public/soccerball.png` (transparent PNG). Marimo only serves static files from the `public/` folder at `/public/...` — do not put the image in the project root. Replace that file to change the icon site-wide. The cursor includes a light particle trail (`wc-head.html` + `wc-theme.css`); respects `prefers-reduced-motion`.

## Quick start

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.10+
- pip

### Install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Redeem-Grimm-Satoshi/boston-wc2026-planner.git
cd boston-wc2026-planner
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Run

In app mode (code hidden, presentation-ready):

```bash
marimo run submission.py
```

In edit mode (for development):

```bash
marimo edit submission.py
```

Both commands serve the notebook at `http://localhost:2718`.

### Optional MBTA API key

The MBTA V3 API rate-limits anonymous requests to 20 req/min per IP. To raise the limit to 1000 req/min (useful when running for a group or polling more aggressively), grab a free key at <https://api-v3.mbta.com> and set:

```bash
export MBTA_API_KEY=your_key_here  # macOS / Linux
$env:MBTA_API_KEY = "your_key_here"  # Windows PowerShell
```

The notebook picks it up automatically — no code changes needed.

## Tech stack

- **[Marimo](https://marimo.io)** — reactive Python notebook + app runtime
- **[Folium](https://python-visualization.github.io/folium/)** — Leaflet-based interactive maps
- **[Altair](https://altair-viz.github.io)** — declarative charts
- **pandas** + **requests** — data wrangling and HTTP
- Embedded JavaScript for live MBTA vehicle interpolation

## How the reactive flow works

The notebook is built on Marimo's reactive cell graph. The user-facing flow:

1. **Pick a match** → resolves `selected_match` (gated behind a sticky Start button).
2. **Enter a starting address** → Nominatim geocodes to lat/lon + Wikipedia hero image.
3. **Click Start** → the entire downstream graph hydrates: weather fetch, closest-station resolution, OSRM driving estimate, MBTA bus connection lookup, places map with cuisine flag highlighting, family-friendly city overlay, and personalized conclusion.

Every downstream cell gates on `mo.stop(selected_match is None)` so the page is empty until the visitor commits to a match.
